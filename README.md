# primenumbers  
Program that generates n amount of primes
  
## How to run  
* To run tests: ./test in command line when in project directory
* To run program: ./main in command line when in project directory  
  
## What I am pleased with  
Implementation is simple and easy to understand. Testing has allowed me to make the assumption that my algorithm should work for a large n.
## What I would do to improve it  
At the moment the output formatting is fine for a small n. However for a bigger n my current implementation would definitely leave a lot to be desired. If I had more time I would probably use ioctl and iomanip to make the output more adaptable for a larger n input.
